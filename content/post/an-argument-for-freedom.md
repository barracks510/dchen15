A few days ago, I noticed a new set of computers being delivered to the ITS
building, and watched as a Windows image was being loaded onto each of the
machines. Of course, seeing this event greatly bothered me, so I suggested that
we replace the proprietary software with Free Software. This was met with a
challenge, that it may possibly be considered if I had a proof-of-concept model
that allowed all of these applications to be run under a GNU/ environment.

I mentioned this to my academic advisor, which started of a chain of
converstation between the ITS department, members of the Science Department,
and myself.

In response to the new wave of computers being installed at Simon's Rock, I
wrote the following email:
